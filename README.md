This project analyzes and visualizes sea level rise trends using historical data. It employs Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy to process data from a CSV file, create a scatter plot of sea level measurements over time, and generate two lines of best fit for different time periods. The first line projects the trend from 1880 to 2050, while the second focuses on data from 2000 onward, offering a more recent perspective. The resulting plot, saved as an image, provides a clear visual representation of past sea level changes and future projections, serving as a tool for understanding long-term environmental trends related to climate change.
